# Contributing

## Template

Please use the following canvas for each documentation. Create a new sub-section with:

- General name of a documentation as the title
- Describe the general content in a few lines
- When it is a set of files or an archive, list the main files
- Is there team in charge of its maintenance, how are updates being managed, is the doc under a revision control system - or is the documentation “on hold”
- Location, access (public or protected)
- Format of the document(s) (README, Latex, etc.) and indexing software (HTML, Github, Confluence, JIRA, any other wiki-style, plain file system-style, etc.)
- Mark the content with respect to the 5 levels of documentation (see list above) - several levels are possible
- when relevant, say something about strengths or weaknesses of this doc, how would you like to see this piece of doc evolve

## Types of documentation

Additional definitions: 5 levels of documentation have been defined, which should be referred (as a best guess) for each piece or set of documentation that is added,

1. documentation close to the codes and the code commits, documentation at the time of Pull Requests (GIT)
2. technical documentation automatically generated from the code (comments, additional Latex-style equations) using tools like “doxygen” or “ford”
3. scientific documentation: comprehensive documentation on equations however with no specific information on data flow, call trees, names of variables or namelist options
4. practical guides: namelists, how-to’s
5. documentation about ancillary tools (like SAPP, LOKI, etc.)
