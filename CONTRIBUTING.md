# Contributing

Contributions are welcome from all to add new sources of relevant documentation.

## Template

Please use the following canvas for each documentation. Create a new sub-section with:

- General name of a documentation as the title
- Describe the general content in a few lines
- When it is a set of files or an archive, list the main files
- Is there team in charge of its maintenance, how are updates being managed, is the doc under a revision control system - or is the documentation “on hold”
- Location, access (public or protected)
- Format of the document(s) (README, Latex, etc.) and indexing software (HTML, Github, Confluence, JIRA, any other wiki-style, plain file system-style, etc.)
- Mark the content with respect to the 5 levels of documentation (see list above) - several levels are possible
- when relevant, say something about strengths or weaknesses of this doc, how would you like to see this piece of doc evolve
